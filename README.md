# RayTracer

RayTracer in C++

## Overview

This is a simple RayTracer implemented in C++. It follows the principles outlined in the books ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and ["Ray Tracing: The Next Week"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html).

## How to Start

To compile and run the RayTracer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/RayTracer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd RayTracer
    ```

3. Compile the source code:

    ```bash
    g++ src/main.cpp -o rayTracer
    ```

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./rayTracer > output_file.ppm
    ```

This will generate the rendered image using the implemented RayTracer.
